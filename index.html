    <h1>LAURIE: It’s no use Jo</h1>
    <p>we’ve got to have it out..</p>

    <p>JO No, no, we don’t...</p>

    <h2>LAURIE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cEg2HCl50I">I’ve loved you ever
      since I’ve known you Jo–</a> </h2>
    <p>I couldn’t help it, and
    you’ve been so good to me –
    <br>I’ve tried to show it
    but you wouldn’t let me;
    now I’m going to make you
    hear and give me an answer
    because I can’t go on
    like this any longer.</p>


    <p>JO I wanted to save you from
    this, I thought you’d understand.</p>

    <p>LAURIE (not listening to her)
      <ul>
    <li>I’ve worked hard to please you
    <li>I gave up billiards and everything you didn’t like
    <li>I waited and never complained
    <li>I hoped you’d love me,
    </ul>
    though I’m not half good enough –</p>

    <p><h3>JO Yes, you are, you’re a
    great deal too good for me,</h3>
    <br>and I’m so grateful to
    you and so proud of you,
    <br>I don’t see why I... I can’t
    love you as you want me to.</p>

    <p>LAURIE You...can’t?</p>

    <p>JO (helplessly)
    I can’t change the feeling and
    it would be a lie to
    say I do when I don’t.
    I’m so sorry, Teddy,
    so desperately sorry,
    but I can’t help it...</p>

    <p>LAURIE I can’t love any one else.</p>

    <p>JO It would be a disaster
    if we married, we’d be miserable!
    We both have such quick tempers –</p>

    <p>LAURIE -- If you loved me Jo,
    I would be a perfect saint!</p>

    <p>JO I can’t - I’ve tried it and failed.</p>


    <p>LAURIE Everyone expects it –
    Grandpa and your family,
    Jo, say you will and let’s be happy!</p>

    <p>JO I can’t say “Yes” truly
    so I won’t say it at all.
    You’ll see that I’m right, eventually,
    and you’ll thank me for it.</p>

    <p>LAURIE (angrily) I’ll be hanged if I do!</p>

    <p>JO You’ll find some
    lovely accomplished girl,
    who will adore you,
    and make a fine mistress
    for your fine house.
    I wouldn’t.
    I’m homely and awkward and odd
    and you’d be ashamed of me
    and we would quarrel –
    we can’t help it even now! –
    I’d hate elegant society and
    you’d hate my scribbling
    and we would be unhappy
    and wish we hadn’t done it
    and everything will be horrid.</p>

    <p>LAURIE (coldly) Anything more?</p>

    <p>JO Nothing more -- except that...
    I don’t believe I will ever marry.
    I’m happy as I am,
    and love my liberty too well to
    be in any hurry to give it up.</p>

    <p>LAURIE (shaking his head)
    You will care for somebody,
    and you’ll love him tremendously,
    and live and die for him.
    I know you will, it’s your way...
    and you will...and I’ll watch.</p>
